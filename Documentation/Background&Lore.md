### Background + Lore
The original plan for this game was to design an interactive potion brewing game where the player would ‘catch’ ingredients flying by to brew potions. The main menu was designed with this idea in mind, which is why there are recipes on the main menu screen that aren’t in the game. The idea pivoted to the final product due to the original game idea not having the ability to fulfil most of the requirements and did not seem appropriate for this project.

The final game ended up being a ‘Cauldron defender’ as opposed to Potion Simulator but most of the original UI was designed for Potion Simulator. 
Essentially, once you start playing the game you can control a ‘Shield’ which during development transformed into a wooden ladle to fit in with the game topic of potions. You can control this shield using ‘A’ and ‘D’ keys and move the ladle across the screen (no Y-axis movement). The shield is intentionally designed to be slow to move to increase the difficulty of the game as it isn’t the most challenging game. 

You use the shield to protect your cauldron which is brewing up your very delicate potions that cannot be disturbed by any additional ingredients getting into it (that’s the game lore at least) so you must intercept any ingredients (or ‘flyers’ as per game files) headed towards the cauldron with your ladle. If a flyer reaches the cauldron it bubbles up and overflows, ruining your potion and you lose the game.

There are 4 types of flyers sent by your competition (other wizards brewing potions) to sabotage your operations. They are: Strawberries, Pineapples, Bananas and Bombs. Whilst they all look happy and cheerful, it is just a façade (maybe except the bomb).

The game is set in a peaceful valley where the weather is not a thing of worry.
